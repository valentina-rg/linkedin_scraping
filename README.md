# Web Scraping for Data Analyst Jobs in Italy

This project aims to scrape job listings for data analyst positions in Italy from various job websites. It utilizes the Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries for web scraping.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to gather information about data analyst job opportunities in Italy from online job portals. By scraping job listings, we can analyze trends, requirements, and demand for data analyst positions in the Italian job market.

## Libraries Used

- Beautiful Soup: For parsing HTML and navigating the DOM structure of web pages.
- Selenium: For automating web browser interactions and dynamic content loading.

## How It Works

The web scraping process involves the following steps:

1. **Navigating to Job Portals**: Selenium is used to automate the process of navigating to job portals such as LinkedIn.
2. **Scraping Job Listings**: Beautiful Soup is employed to parse the HTML content of job listings pages and extract relevant information such as job titles, companies, locations, and job descriptions.
3. **Data Analysis**: Once the job data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify trends, common requirements, and popular job locations.

## Requirements

- Python installed on your system.
- Required libraries installed: Beautiful Soup, Selenium.
- Web driver for Selenium compatible with your web browser (e.g., Chrome driver).

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the web scraping script:

1. Install Python and the required libraries: `pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium`.
2. Download the appropriate web driver for Selenium and place it in your system PATH or specify its location in the script.
3. Execute the Python script (`main.py`) in your preferred environment.
4. Review the scraped job data and analyze the results.
